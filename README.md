In this repo are a bunch of scripts and programs I wrote for analyzing MRI (Structural, task fMRI, resting-state fMRI, and diffusion) data for various projects at MIT and BU. 

Since I use FSL, FreeSurfer and sometime SPM for this kind of analysis, a lot of the scripts here will depend on those software packages.

Contact me at shanqing.cai@gmail.com if you have any questions.
